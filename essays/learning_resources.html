                        <h2>Hardware</h2>
                        <p>Hardware is trickier.  Everything I've learned came from firsthand experience.</p>
                        <p>The main difference between software and hardware is that there are no real consequences for failure in software.  If you code doesn't compile, just debug and try again.  If you mess things up too badly, you can always git revert.  As such, software favors a rapid, iterative development style.</p>
                        <p>With hardware, failure often means ruining a valuable piece of equipment.  Burning up a servomotor by miscalibrating the power supply is practically a rite of passage.  As a result, hardware favors more up-front planning.  "Measure twice, cut once."</p>
                        <p>At the most foundational level, hardware requires a certain level of hand-eye coordination that's difficult to teach.  I took this for granted until I interviewed a technician candidate that couldn't handle a screwdriver without dropping the screw a dozen times.  I don't know how to teach this any other way except experience.</p>
                        <p>I acquired basic tool competency from a childhood spent building and fixing things.  Advanced tricks (wiring, soldering, electrical work, avionics, etc.) came from on-the-job experience at a drone startup.  To anyone looking to learn, I recommend that you find a way into a workshop any way you can.  Your rate of learning will be at least an order of magnitude higher than consuming online content.</p>
                        <p>If that's somehow unavailable to you, I recommend getting access to a 3D printer and just making things.  Past the initial investment, each marginal print is very cheap.  This permits an iterative approach to building that is forgiving of mistakes.  Start with pure 3D-printed structures, then begin integrating electronics for more advanced projects.</p>
